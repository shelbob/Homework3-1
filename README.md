What do you tell people about your field of study at a party: We're interested in using physical activity to improve mental health
In the past month, what are the three main activities you have been doing at work/study: Writing/revising two papers; preparing for a new study
What are the three most important tools/strategies you use for organizing your work: CyBox, REDCap, Outlook


That sounds like an interesting study! I would love to hear more about it. I also work for a profesor but we do a lot of sustainability work. CyBox is definitly something I am familiar with as well.
