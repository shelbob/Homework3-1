I am Shelby Nechkash

I study Agricultural Studies with a focus on animal science, sustainability, and data science

Recently I have been working on Greenhouse gas analysis for a company out of Des Moines. I also have another job working for the City of Ames running their smart energy and smart business challenge programs. I have also been studying more social and economic sustainability to supplement what I know about enviornmental sustainability. 

For keeping organized I like to makee to-do lists, write down all inportand dates in my google calandar, and make a priority list of tasks so I know what I must finish first.

That sounds like an interesting study! I would love to hear more about it. I also work for a profesor but we do a lot of sustainability work. CyBox is definitly something I am familiar with as well.
